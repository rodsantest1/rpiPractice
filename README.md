Raspberry Pi 3  
VS Code blank screen start up issue  

Resolution:  
```code . --disable-gpu```

Deleted keyring login  so I can push to GitHub from vscode.
```Goto Activities and search for keys.```  

Debian 9 Notes  
Settings > Privacy > Turn off screen lock  
Settings > Power > Screen saver > Never  

Todo:   
Why is keyring prompting me in vscode all the time.
